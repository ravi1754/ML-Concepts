1. For a dice, which of the following outcomes is more likely? (dice has been rolled thrice)<br>
   Given, P(1) = 0.1,P(2) = 0.1,P(4) = 0.1,P(5) = 0.1,P(6) = 0.1<br>
    a. 1,2,6<br>
    b. 6,6,1<br>
    c. 3,1,3<br>
    d. All outcomes are equally likely<br>
2. Given that {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} are sampled from a gaussian distribution, write down the equation for the estimates of mean and variance?<br>
   How did you get this equation ?<br>
3. Given X1, X2 , X3,..... Xn are random variable which follow U[0,1] ( uniform distribution ). Find probability distribution function of max(X1, X2 , X3,..... Xn) ?<br>
4. If a person throws a dart onto a circular board of radius 'S' and the probability of dart hitting any point on the board follows uniform distribution, what is the expected distance from the center of the board?<br>
5. A coin has probability of **p** to get HEAD. The coin will be  tossed continuously  till 5 consecutive heads are landed. What is the expected number of times the coin needs to be tossed?<br>
